<h1>Class Screen Design</h1>
<p>Each print and draw commands are stored in two lists, so when the paint method is called, it prints/draws the commands in the order they were called.  The clear command deletes all items from the list.</p>
<p>The public methods encode the draw command into a Command object (see Design-Class-Command.html for more details) and add it to the list.  The print commands are stored in a StringBuffer, and then formated to the given screen size and stored in list, where each entry is a line on the screen.  The color, screen, zoom, clear, width, and height commands are not stored in any list, since they don't print or draw anything.</p>
<p>The paint method reads the list and prints/draws accordingly.  The paint method will try to use Graphics methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Text printed will be fixed length.  If the print/println command exceeds the width of the screen, then the text will warp.  The text command will not do this however.  If the text lines exceede the height of the screen, the oldest lines are deleted and the text is shuffled up.</p>
