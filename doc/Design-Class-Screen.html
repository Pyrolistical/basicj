<h1>Class Screen Design</h1>
<p>Each print and draw commands are stored in two lists, so when the paint method is called, it prints/draws the commands in the order they were called.  The clear command deletes all items from the list.</p>
<p>The zoom command is infensible to implement using the getScaledInstance() method from BufferedImage</p>
<p>The public methods encode the draw command into a Command object (see Design-Class-Command.html for more details).  The print commands are stored in a list of Pairs consisting of a Color and a StringBuffer.  Any '\n' characters are converted into hardBreaks, and softBreaks are added at screen width.  This new structure is stored in formatedPrintBuffer.</p>
<p>The commands are then drawn on two buffers, print and draw.  Then the two buffers are composed on to the back buffer, which is then finally painted.</p>
<p>The paint method reads the list and prints/draws accordingly.  The paint method will try to use Graphics methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Text printed will be fixed length.  If the print/println command exceeds the width of the screen, then the text will warp.  The text command will not do this however.  If the text lines exceede the height of the screen, the oldest lines are deleted and the text is shuffled up.</p>
