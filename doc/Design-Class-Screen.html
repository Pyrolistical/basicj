<h1>Class Screen Design</h1>
<p>Each print/draw/color command will have to be stored in a list, so when the paint method is called, it prints/draws the commands in the order they were called.  The clear command deletes all items from the list.</p>
<p>The public methods encode the command into a Command object (see Design-Class-Command.html for more details) and add it to the list.  The clear, width, and height commands are an exception, since they don't print or draw anything.</p>
<p>The paint method reads the list and prints/draws accordingly.  The paint method will try to use Graphics methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Text printed will be fixed length.  If the print/println command exceeds the width of the screen, then the text will warp.  The text command will not do this however.</p>
