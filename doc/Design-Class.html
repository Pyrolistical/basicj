<h1>Class Design</h1>
<p>The BasicJ class extends JFrame, and holds all the logic for the menu and zoom override.</p>
<p>BasicJ delegates all the core api commands, except the wait and math related commands, to the follow classes:
<ul>
	<li>Screen - this JComponent handles all the print/drawing, input and event commands (commands: 1a, 1c-l, 1ah, 7a-b).  Command 1b is implemented by calling print("\n").  Screen only implements print(String s), and the BasicJ class casts all base types to String.</li>
	<li>FileIO - this class handles the file io commands (commands: 7c-f)</li>
</ul>
</p>
