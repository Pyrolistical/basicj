<h1>BasicJ API Phases</h1>
<p>Alpha 1 - Implement the Screen class with all the print/draw/color commands, ie. leave out the input and event commands</p>
<p>Alpha 2 - Implement the Math class implemented in full</p>
<p>Alpha 3 - Implement the input and wait command</p>
<p>Alpha 4 - Implement the menu/zoom override working in the main Frame</p>
<p>Alpha 5 - Implement the FileIO class in full</p>
<p>Alpha 6 - Implement the event commands in the Screen class</p>
<p>Beta 1 - Do more intensive testing of whole api</p>
<p>Beta 2 - Write more advanced programs in BasicJ to test it, Tetris for example</p>
<p>Release - Release of just the API packaged in a Jar file</p>
