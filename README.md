basicj
======

A teaching tool that teachers can use to teach basic programming concepts without the full complexities of Java.

This is implemented in pure Java to allow students to graduate into a real language when they are ready.

See [samples](https://github.com/Pyrolistical/basicj/tree/master/src/main/java/basicj/samples) to get started.
